In a Node.js application, the order of execution of these files typically follows a structured flow. Here’s how it usually works:

config.env:
--------------

This file contains environment variables that are loaded at the start of the application using packages like dotenv.

It is often loaded first to ensure all configuration settings are available throughout the application.

server.js:
-------------

This file is the entry point of your Node.js application.

It initializes the server and requires other modules like app.js.

It sets up the server to listen on a specified port.

app.js:
-------

This file sets up the Express application.

It includes middleware, routes, and other configurations.

It doesn’t start the server; it’s more about configuring the application.

router.js:
---------

This file defines the routes and associates them with controller functions.

It is required in app.js to mount the routes on the Express application.

controller.js:
--------------

This file contains the functions that handle the requests for each route.

It is required by router.js to link the route endpoints with the appropriate logic.

Execution Flow
--------------
Initialization:
---------------

The process starts by running server.js.

Loading Configuration:
---------------------

server.js may load the config.env file using dotenv.config() if environment variables are needed.

Setup Express Application:
---------------------------

server.js requires app.js, which sets up the Express application.

Mount Routes:
--------------

app.js requires router.js to define the routes.

router.js requires controller.js to associate route handlers with the routes.

Start Server:
------------

Finally, server.js starts the server and listens on the specified port.

Here's an illustrative flow:
